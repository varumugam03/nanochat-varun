    Newton-Schulz iteration to compute the zeroth power / orthogonalization of G. We opt to use a

    of minimizing steps, it turns out to be empirically effective to keep increasing the slope at
    zero even beyond the point where the iteration no longer converges all the way to one everywhere
    on the interval. This iteration therefore does not produce UV^T but rather something like US'V^T
    where S' is diagonal with S_{ii}' ~ Uniform(0.5, 1.5), which turns out not to hurt model
    performance at all relative to UV^T, where USV^T = G is the SVD.

    Muon - MomentUm Orthogonalized by Newton-schulz

    https://kellerjordan.github.io/posts/muon/

    Muon internally runs standard SGD-momentum, and then performs an orthogonalization post-
    processing step, in which each 2D parameter's update is replaced with the nearest orthogonal
    matrix. To efficiently orthogonalize each update, we use a Newton-Schulz iteration, which has
    the advantage that it can be stably run in bfloat16 on the GPU.

    Some warnings:
    - This optimizer should not be used for the embedding layer, the final fully connected layer,
    or any {0,1}-D parameters; those should all be optimized by a standard method (e.g., AdamW).
    - To use it with 4D convolutional filters, it works well to just flatten their last 3 dimensions.

    Arguments:
        lr: The learning rate used by the internal SGD.
        momentum: The momentum used by the internal SGD.
        nesterov: Whether to use Nesterov-style momentum in the internal SGD. (recommended)
        ns_steps: The number of Newton-Schulz iteration steps to use.
